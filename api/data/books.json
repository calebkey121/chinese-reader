        "text": "我回到这个地方的时候，天已经快黑了。\n\n车站还是那个车站，只是看起来更小了。墙上的字有些掉了漆，灯也比我记得的要黄。我站在门口，突然不知道该往哪边走。明明这条路我小时候走过无数次，可是现在，每一步都像是踩在别人的记忆里。\n\n我带的东西不多，一个背包，一只旧箱子。箱子上有一道很浅的划痕，是很多年前留下的。我摸了一下那条痕，手指停了停，像是在确认这不是梦。\n\n外面没有人等我。我也没有告诉太多人我会回来。说到底，我不是回来见谁的。我只是觉得——如果再不回来一次，我可能会永远错过某个答案。\n\n我沿着路往镇里走。路两边的店铺关了大半，剩下的几家开着灯，里面的人影很慢，像是在和时间讨价还价。风从河那边吹来，带着潮湿的味道，也带着一种说不出的凉意。我闻到那味道时，心里忽然紧了一下。\n\n河一直在那儿。它不急，也不慢，像一条习惯了沉默的线，把镇子分成两边。小时候我们总说，河那边是“另一边”，像是另外一个世界。我现在才明白，所谓“另一边”，有时候不是地理，而是人心里不愿意碰的地方。\n\n走到桥头的时候，我停下来。桥上的木板换过了，栏杆也重新刷了漆，可是桥头那块石头还在。石头上有一道裂缝，像一条细细的嘴，永远不肯合上。小时候我总爱在这里坐一会儿，听水声，等天黑再回家。我记得那时候我不怕黑。现在我站在这里，却觉得背后好像有人在看我。\n\n我回头，当然什么都没有。只有路灯下的一只狗。\n\n它是黑色的，毛不长，眼睛却很亮。它站得不近不远，像是刻意保持距离。它没有叫，也没有摇尾巴，只是安静地看着我。我本来想绕开，可是它往前走了两步，又停下，像是在问：“你还记得我吗？”\n\n我不认识它。我也不敢说我不认识。因为在这一刻，我突然意识到——在这个镇上，很多“我以为我不认识”的东西，其实都可能认识我。\n\n“你是谁家的？”我低声问。\n\n狗当然没有回答。它只是转过身，慢慢往镇子的方向走。我犹豫了一下，还是跟了上去。不是因为我喜欢狗，而是因为它走得很确定，像知道我要去哪里。\n\n我们走过一条很窄的巷子，巷子尽头有一盏旧灯，灯下停着一辆三轮车。车旁边坐着一只白猫。\n\n它把身体缩得很小，尾巴绕在前爪旁边，看起来像一团很干净的影子。听到脚步声，它抬起头，眼神很冷，却没有害怕。它看了黑狗一眼，又看了我一眼，像是在判断我是不是“该出现的人”。\n\n我忍不住笑了一下：“现在连猫狗都来欢迎我了？”\n\n白猫没有动。黑狗也没有动。那一刻，空气里有一种奇怪的安静，像是所有声音都在等我说错一句话。\n\n我把笑收回去，轻声说：“我只是回来住几天。”\n\n白猫眨了一下眼。那动作很慢，像是在说：“你以为你能决定只住几天？”\n\n黑狗继续往前走。我走了两步，白猫也跳下车，跟在后面。它走得很轻，几乎没有声音。黑狗走得很稳，像在巡逻。我们三个谁都没有说话，可是我却觉得他们之间好像在交流一种我听不见的语言。\n\n我忽然想起小时候的一件事。\n\n那一年夏天特别热。我跟着大人去河边。有人在桥上争吵，声音很大。我记得我站得很远，可是我还是听见了自己的心跳。后来大人把我拉走，说不要看，不要问。回家的路上，我一直回头，可是河那边的树影越来越黑，像是把什么东西吞了进去。\n\n我当时以为那只是大人的事，和我没有关系。可我也记得，从那天以后，家里有人变得很沉默。有人不再提起某个名字。有人开始很早就关门。河还是那条河，只是我们再也不随便去桥头坐着了。\n\n现在，黑狗带着我走的方向，正是我小时候不敢去的那条路。\n\n我停下脚步。黑狗回头看我。它的眼神不像一只普通的狗，更像一个在等我做决定的人。\n\n“我不想去那边。”我说。\n\n白猫站在一旁，尾巴轻轻一摆，像是在笑我。它没有出声，但那种轻微的动作比任何话都更刺。\n\n黑狗没有催我，只是站着。过了几秒，它转身走到我脚边，用鼻子轻轻碰了一下我的裤脚，然后又往前走了一步。\n\n那一下很轻，却像一只手。\n\n我深吸了一口气，继续跟上去。\n\n路越走越窄，两边的墙也越高。远处有一家亮着灯的小店，门口挂着一串风铃，风一吹，声音很清脆。我走近时，看见店里坐着一个老太太。\n\n她抬起头，看见我，脸上没有惊讶，反而像早就知道我会来。她的眼睛很浑，却很稳。她看了看黑狗，又看了看白猫，最后才看向我。\n\n“回来了？”她说。\n\n我点头：“王奶奶……您还记得我？”\n\n她笑了一下，笑得很短：“我当然记得。你走的时候，还没这么高。”\n\n我不知道该怎么接。很多话堵在喉咙里，可是我说不出来。老太太也没有逼我，只是把手里的茶杯放下，看着我，好像在等我自己开口。\n\n黑狗趴在门口，像守门。白猫跳到柜台边，坐得很端正，像是这家店的主人。王奶奶看着它们，眼神里没有意外，只有一种习惯了的平静。\n\n她轻声说：“你终于还是回来了。”\n\n“我只是……”我想说我只是路过，或者我只是想住几天，可是话到嘴边，变得很薄，很没用。\n\n王奶奶没有笑我。她只是慢慢地说：“河那边的事，你一直没忘，对吗？”\n\n我手指一紧。茶杯里的热气往上升，模糊了我的视线。我想否认，可是我发现自己连否认的力气都没有。\n\n黑狗在门口动了一下。白猫的尾巴垂下来，轻轻扫过柜台，像在提醒我：别说太多，别说错。\n\n我看着王奶奶，过了很久才说：“我回来……是想知道，那天到底发生了什么。”\n\n王奶奶没有立刻回答。她把目光移向窗外，窗外正对着河的方向。夜色已经压下来，河面看不清，只剩下一点点反光，像有人把一把刀藏在水里。\n\n她低声说：“你想知道答案，就别只站在这边。”\n\n我心里一沉。黑狗抬起头，看着我。白猫的眼睛在灯光下像两点冷光。\n\n我明白了。\n\n我回来的第一天，就已经被带到桥边了。",

        "text": "我在王奶奶的店里坐了很久。\n\n她没有继续问我，也没有立刻讲河那边的事。她只是给我倒了杯热茶，动作很慢，像是在给时间找一个合适的速度。黑狗趴在门口，一动不动。白猫坐在柜台上，眼睛半闭，像是在休息，可我知道它没有真的睡着。\n\n“你现在住哪儿？”王奶奶终于开口。\n\n“还没找好。”我说，“可能先住两天旅店。”\n\n她点点头，没有多说什么。她看我的方式，让我有一种奇怪的感觉——不是好奇，也不是同情，更像是一种早就知道结果的平静。\n\n我起身告辞的时候，白猫从柜台上跳下来，走到门口，又停下，回头看了我一眼。黑狗站起身，先我一步走了出去。\n\n夜已经深了，镇子却没有完全睡着。路灯下偶尔有人影走过，脚步不快不慢，像是在遵守某种我已经忘记的节奏。黑狗走在前面，我跟在后面。白猫不紧不慢地跟着我们，始终保持着一点距离。\n\n“你们不用送我。”我低声说。\n\n他们当然没有回应。\n\n旅店在河的这一边，离桥不远。柜台后面坐着一个中年男人，他抬头看了我一眼，又低头继续看报纸。\n\n“住几天？”他问。\n\n“先两天。”\n\n他在本子上写了几笔，没有多问我的名字，也没有问我从哪儿来，仿佛这里的人都习惯了不问多余的事。我接过钥匙，上楼的时候，下意识回头看了一眼门口。\n\n黑狗没有进来，只是站在路灯下。白猫坐在墙头，影子被灯拉得很长。它们没有要跟上的意思。\n\n那一刻，我竟然有点失落。\n\n房间不大，却很干净。窗户正对着河的方向，拉开窗帘，就能看见远处微弱的水光。我站在窗前，看了很久，直到灯光在水面上被风吹得断断续续，像一条快要消失的线。\n\n我本来以为，回到这里会让我安心。可真正站在这个地方，我却发现自己比以前更清楚地意识到：有些东西，我从来没有真正离开过。\n\n第二天早上，我被街上的声音吵醒。\n\n有人在说话，有车经过，还有很轻的脚步声。我洗了把脸，下楼的时候，看见黑狗坐在门口，像是守了一夜。白猫不在。\n\n“你们一直在这儿？”我问。\n\n黑狗抬头看了我一眼，又低下头。\n\n我走出旅店，沿着熟悉又陌生的街道往前。店铺一间一间开门，面孔却几乎都换了。有人向我点头，有人看了我一眼又移开目光。没有人显得惊讶，也没有人显得热情，仿佛我的出现既不重要，也不多余。\n\n我走进一家小吃店。老板是个我不认识的女人。\n\n“想吃什么？”她问。\n\n“和以前一样吧。”我说完才意识到，她不可能知道我以前吃什么。\n\n她看了我一眼，没有追问，只是随意给我端了一碗面。味道和记忆里的不一样，却又说不出哪里不同。我一口一口吃着，心里却一直空着。\n\n吃到一半，白猫出现在门口。它没有进来，只是坐在外面的台阶上，像是在等我。\n\n我结了账，走出去。它站起身，转身往桥的方向走。我没有犹豫，跟了上去。\n\n白天的河看起来很普通。水不急，岸边的树影也很安静。桥上偶尔有人走过，车不多，风却比昨晚更冷。白猫走到桥头就停下了，没有像黑狗那样继续往前。\n\n“你不走？”我问。\n\n它看着河面，尾巴轻轻摆了一下，没有看我。\n\n我站在它旁边，顺着它的目光看过去。河那边的房子显得很旧，墙上有斑驳的痕迹，像是被时间反复触碰过。那一刻，我突然意识到，我其实并不确定，自己想知道的究竟是什么。\n\n我只是觉得，有些事情如果不亲眼看一眼，我这辈子都会被它们牵着。\n\n黑狗不知道什么时候出现了。它站在我身后，距离不远不近。\n\n“你们每天都会来这里吗？”我问。\n\n白猫没有回应。黑狗也没有。\n\n可我却明白了：这不是第一次。\n\n我站在桥头，风从河面吹上来，带着潮湿的冷意。昨天王奶奶说的话在我脑中反复出现——“别只站在这边”。\n\n“如果我过去，”我低声说，“你们会跟我一起吗？”\n\n白猫转过头，看了我一眼。那一眼很短，却像是在衡量什么。随后，它跳下台阶，往桥上走了一步，又停住。\n\n黑狗没有动。\n\n那一瞬间，我突然明白，他们并不是在带我走某一条路。真正要不要过去，从一开始，就不是他们能替我决定的事。\n\n桥上的风铃响了一下，声音很轻。\n\n我深吸一口气，向前走了一步。\n\n就在我踏上桥面的那一刻，白猫没有继续往前。它转身，坐回桥头，静静地看着我。黑狗也停在原地，没有跟上。\n\n我站在桥上，第一次清楚地意识到：\n有些路，只能一个人走。\n\n河水在脚下流动，声音很低，却从未停过。\n\n我不知道等我走到那一边，会看见什么。\n我只知道，如果我现在不走，这条路可能会在我心里存在一辈子。\n\n我没有回头。",
